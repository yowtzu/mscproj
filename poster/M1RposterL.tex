``Lies, damn lies and statistics."
-- Mark Twain. \\
Luckily, this course is about probability, so I can leave the lies to the second year lecturers....

Assessment of uncertainty in such real-life problems is a complex
issue which requires a rigorous mathematical treatment.
M1S develops the probability framework in which
questions of practical interest can be posed and resolved.

\item SAMPLE SPACES AND EVENTS
\item PROBABILITY: DEFINITIONS, INTERPRETATIONS
\item CONDITIONAL\ PROBABILITY
\item COMBINATORICS
\item DISCRETE\ RANDOM\ VARIABLES\ 
\item  CONTINUOUS\ RANDOM\ VARIABLES
\item  TRANSFORMATIONS
\item JOINT DISTRIBUTIONS

   The set of {\bf all} possible outcomes is called the {\bf SAMPLE SPACE}, $\Omega$.
\\ \\
If $\omega$ is a possible outcome, $\omega \in \Omega$.
\[
\Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots\}
\]
$\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots$ are {\bf elements} of $\Omega$.

Subsets of $\Omega$ are called {\bf EVENTS}.\\
{\bf DE MORGAN'S LAWS}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(E \cup F)' = E' \cap F'$.
\item $(E \cap F)' = E' \cup F'$.
