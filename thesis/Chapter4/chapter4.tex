\label{cha:po}
Optimal portfolio is the ultimate goal of every investment manager; but the optimality criteria can be very different to each of them. In the infamous Markowitz's modern portfolio theory \cite{HM52}, it is assumed that investor attempt to maximize the return and minimize the risk of his portfolio. For index tracker fund manager, the main objective of portfolio management is to track and replicate the exposure of a benchmark index. The lack of active management generally makes the fund less vulnerable to change of management and has the advantages of lower fees and taxes. It is the latter the focus of the thesis lies.
 
In this chapter, we introduces the index tracking fund and summarise some causing factors of the tracking error between the fund and its benchmark index. We then present how the portfolio optimisation problem in terms of minimising the tracking error can be formulated as a stochastic control problem. Lastly, we show this stochastic control problem can be turned into a path-space parameter estimation problem, in which Rao-Blackwellised SMC can be used to estimate these parameters efficiently.
 
\section{Index Tracking Fund}
An financial index can be thought of a summary statistics of a market, typically formed as weighted average of the prices of some financial instruments. For example, FTSE 100 is an index that attempts to represents the performance of the 100 biggest companies in UK. This index is however not an investable financial product one can invest directly.
 
To allows investors to take exposure to the markets (as represented by the indices), index tracker funds are introduced. These funds generally follow very strict and transparent rules with the main objective to track their benchmark indices as close as possible. Investors of these funds therefore are only exposed to the market risks of the chosen indices, with minimal exposure to the risk associated with the investment process of the traditional active fund management.
 
\subsection{Index Replication}
To track an index, the simplest way is to replicate the index by investing all the components of the benchmark index. However, this can be costly and difficult to manage, considering some of the indices may have huge number of components, e.g., MSCI World index that consists of $\approx 1600$ components from many different countries. Instead, one could partial replicate the index by sampling some of the components that are most representative. This can mean those components with larger weights, more volatiles or less correlated in returns (assuming these returns average out the gain/loss among them). This partial replication could save transaction cost, at the same time, introducing some tracking errors to the funds.
 
Instead of physically replicating the index by investing in the components, the portfolio managers also have the option to enter a swap agreement with a counter-party (typically investment bank) that provides the exact return of the stock market or commodity it's tracking. Essentially, this transfers the market risk to the counter-party, at the same introducing the counter-party default risk. This technique is known synthetic replication.
 
\subsection{Causing factors of tracking error}
To evaluate the performance of index tracking fund, different metrics have been introduced to quantify the mismatch between the performance of the fund and its benchmark index. For example, tracking difference is the sum of absolute difference in returns between of the fund and its benchmark index. Here, we adopt the tracking error as our metric, which is defined to be the standard deviation of the absolute difference of the returns of the fund and the benchmark index defined in \cite{BJ13} as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon = \sqrt{\Var[r_p - r_b]}
\end{equation}
where $r_p$ is the return of the portfolio and $r_b$ is the return of the benchmark index.
 
There are many factors that can cause tracking errors, some of which are summarised as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item benchmark index rebalance --- the benchmark index is re-weighting its constituents periodically to reflex the changes on the market based on its methodology. To track the index, the fund has to adjust its portfolio accordingly. This will incur some transaction costs. During the index rebalance period, cash drag may also  happen between the liquidation of the constituents that have weights reduced/dropped and the addition of the constituents that have weights increased/added. This cash is essentially not participating in the market and therefore it does not reflex the changes on the benchmark index.
\item replication and sampling techniques --- funds may choose to replicate the benchmark index by selecting a subset of the constituents (often the ones with larger weights and more liquid) in an effort to minimize the transaction costs. This exclusion of the smaller, less liquid constituents may introduce another source of tracking error, especially under stressed market.
\item different assumption on dividend reinvestment and taxation --- the benchmark index calculation often assumes immediate reinvestment of dividends on ex-dividend dates but the fund may only able to reinvest the dividend after receiving it. The tax treatment that is applied on the dividends may also be different.
\item total expense ratio --- there is an additional expense charged to the fund on daily basis to cover the management cost.
\end{enumerate}
This list is by no mean exclusive. See \cite{BJ13} for further details.
 
\section{Methodology}
Instead of using a traditional deterministic state space models, we choose to use a \emph{stochastic} modelling approach to carry out the portfolio optimisation. In particular, we focus here the the problem in minimizing the tracking error between a portfolio and its benchmark index.  Our aim is to determine what investment actions (buy or sell) a portfolio manager needs to do for each index component on a daily basis across the investment horizon to track the benchmark index well.

We adopt here conditional Gaussian linear state space model as follows:
\begin{align}
  X_t &= A_t(U_t)X_{t-1} + B_t(U_t)W_t + F_t(U_t) \nonumber \\
  Y_t &= C_t(U_t)X_t + D_t(U_t)V_t + G_t(U_t)
\label{eq:model}
\end{align}
where $\{U_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ is a deterministic control input sequence that is used regulate the hidden states, $A_t$, $B_t$, $C_t$, $D_t$, $F_t$, $G_t$ are appropriate matrix/vector functions of $U_n$ and  $\{W_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ and  $\{V_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ are independent sequences of standard Gaussian random variable, i.e., $W_t, V_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$. The transition density and likelihood of this model are Gaussian distributions with center lied at a point of a linear combination of the known conditional control parameters, $u_t$ of the following form:
\begin{align}
  p_t(u_t \mid u_{t-1}) &= \textrm{(any given form)} \nonumber \\
  f_t(x_t \mid x_{t-1}, u_t) &= \mathcal{N}(A_t(u_t) x_{t-1} + F_t(u_t), B_t(u_t)B_t(u_t)^T) \nonumber \\
  g_t(y_t \mid x_t, u_t)    &= \mathcal{N}(C_t(u_t) x_t + G_t(u_t), D_t(u_t)D_t(u_t)^T)
\end{align}
%This model is by no mean to compete the state of the art model in realistic portfolio optimisation, but rather to motivate further work in this direction.

Based on this model, the optimisation objective is to search for a sequence of controls $u_{1:t}$ that would result in a sequence of observations $y_{1:t}$ that tracks the reference signal $y^{ref}_{1:T}$ as close as possible. This problem is often known as stochastic regulation problem. We adopt the finite horizon multiplicative reward function proposed in \cite{NK11} here:
\begin{equation}
  J(u_{1:T},y^{ref}_{1:T}, x_0) = \E_{x_0}\left[\exp\left( -\dfrac{1}{2}\displaystyle\sum^T_{t=1}\left(\vert\vert y^{ref}_t - C_t(u_t)x_t - G_t(u_t) \vert\vert^2_{Q_t(u_t))^{-1}}  + \vert\vert u_t - u_{t-1} \vert\vert^2_{L_t}\right) \right) \right]
\end{equation}
where $Q(u_t) = D_t(u_t)D_t(u_t)^T$ and $L_t$ are assumed to known. The expectation here is taken with respect to the whole path of the Markov Chain $\{X_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ with the starting point $X_0 = x_0$,  i.e., $E_{x_0}[\phi(X_{1:t})] = \displaystyle\int \phi(X_{1:T}) \prod f_t(x_t \mid x_{t-1})~dx_{1:t}$.

The corresponding optimal open loop policy is:
\begin{equation}
  u^*_{1:T} = \arg\max_{u_{1:T}} J(u_{1:T};y^{ref}_{1:T};x_0)
\label{eq:optcontrol}
\end{equation}
with the assumption that the maximum is attainable. This reward function is closely related to the risk sensitive control discussed in \cite{WR90}, with slightly difference. This reward function used here is absence of an explicitly risk sensitive constant and it also assumes the presence of $y^{ref}_{1:T}$ as the reference target instead of the observable states. Nevertheless, a risk sensitivity constant could still be introduced through $D_n$ and $L_n$ if necessary.

\subsection{Problem formulation}
We assume here that the sequence of controls $\{U_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ is a Markov process with transition distribution $p(u_t \mid u_{t-1})$. The objective is to compute the marginal posterior distribution density:
\begin{equation}
 \pi_t(u_{1:t}) = p(u_{1:t} \mid y^{ref}_{1:t})
\end{equation} 
by standard marginalisation the distribution $p(x_{1:t}, u_{1:t} \mid y_{1:t})$ which in itself satisfies the following recursive equation:
\begin{align}
  p(x_{1:t}, u_{1:t} \mid y_{1:t}) = p(x_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t-1} \mid y_{1:t-1}) \frac{p(y_t \mid x_t, u_t)p(x_t, u_t \mid x_{t-1}, u_{t-1})}{p(y_t \mid y_{1:t-1})}
\end{align}
 
% This posterior desntiy function can be derived as follows:
%\begin{align}
%p(u_{0:t} \mid y^{ref}_{0:t}) &\propto p(u_{0:t}) p(y^{ref}_{0:t} \mid u_{0:t}) \\
%&= \prod^t_{i=1} p(y^{ref} \mid y^{ref}_{0:i-1}, u_{0:i}) p(u_i \mid u_{i-1})
%\end{align}
 
%\begin{align}
%p(u_{0:t} \mid y_{0:t}) &\propto p(y_k \mid u_{0:t}, y_{0:t-1}) p(u_{0:t} \mid y_{0:t-1}) \nonumber \\
%&=  p(y_k \mid u_{0:t}, y_{0:t-1}) p(u_t \mid u_{0:t-1}, y_{0:t-1}) p(u_{0:t-1} \mid y_{0:t-1}) \nonumber \\
%&=  p(u_{0:t-1} \mid y_{0:t-1}) p(y_k \mid u_{0:t}, y_{0:t-1}) p(u_t \mid u_{t-1}, y_{0:t-1})
%\end{align}
 
One straight-forward way to approximate the recursion is directly apply SMC algorithm by consider the hidden states is a sequence of paired states $\{(U_t, X_t)\}_{t \geq 0}$. A better approach would be using the Rao-Blackwellised SMC mentioned in Section \ref{sec:msmc}, attempts to do as much computation analytically as possible, by splitting the states into the linear Gaussian states and the non-linear states. Then, the Kalman Filter can be used to model and track the linear Gaussian states and the SMC is only required to model and track the non-linear states. This marginalisation setting often yields estimates with smaller variance.

To use Rao-Blackwellised SMC on this model, we consider the following factorisation on the full posterior distribution as follows:
\begin{equation}
  p(u_{1:t}, x_{1:t} \mid y_{1:t}) = p(x_{1:t} \mid u_{1:t}, y_{1:t}) p(u_{1:t} \mid y_{1:t})
\end{equation}
Looking at the right hand side of the equation, the first term is obviously Gaussian and can therefore can be estimated optimally using Kalman Filter recursions described in Appendix \ref{sec:KF}. For the second term, we can rewrite it into the following recursion form:
\begin{align}
p(u_{1:t} \mid y_{1:t}) &\propto p(y_t \mid u_{1:t}, y_{1:t-1}) p(u_{1:t} \mid y_{1:t-1}) \nonumber \\
&=  p(y_t \mid u_{1:t}, y_{1:t-1}) p(u_t \mid u_{1:t-1}, y_{1:t-1}) p(u_{1:t-1} \mid y_{1:t-1}) \nonumber \\
&=  p(u_{1:t-1} \mid y_{1:t-1}) p(y_t \mid u_{1:t}, y_{1:t-1}) p(u_t \mid u_{1:t-1}, y_{1:t-1})
\label{eq:msmc}
\end{align}
Assuming that it is also possible to decompose the selected importance density into recursion form as follows:
\begin{equation}
        q_{1:t}(u_{1:t} \mid y_{1:t}) = q_{1:t-1}(u_{1:t-1} \mid y_{1:t-1}) q_t(u_t \mid u_{1:t-1}, y_{1:t})
\label{eq:q2}
\end{equation}
then the associated unnormalized weight of each sample can be derived in a similar fashion as given in Section \ref{sec:SIS} into the recursion form as follows:
\begin{equation}
   \tilde{w}_t  = \tilde{w}_{t-1} \dfrac{p_t(u_t \mid u_{t-1})p_t(y_t \mid u_{1:t}, y_{1:t-1})}{q_t(u_t \mid u_{1:t-1}, y_{1:t})}
   \label{eq:wsmsc}
\end{equation}
Compare to \eqref{eq:w}, the main difference here is that the weights now depends on the whole path space from time step $1$ to $t$.

\subsection{Extensions}
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:ess}, the resampling step introduces variance to the the weights, but it is necessary to avoid accumulation of estimation variance onto the weights over time. Effective sample size (ESS) can be used to measure the quality of the weight and trigger the resampling step only if necessary, e.g., 
when the ESS value at time step $t$ fall below certain threshold at time $t$, say $\frac{N}{2}$.

To add diversity in the population of particles, the Resample-Move step introduced in Section \ref{sec:rm} can be included. This step perturbs the samples yet leave the distribution the samples represent unchanged using a MCMC kernel that is invariant in density. With this optional step in place, the whole algorithm is summarised in Algorithm \ref{algo:msmc}.

\begin{algorithm}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{MAP estimation for the control sequence}
Based on the model defined in \eqref{eq:model}, the conditional likelihood density of the model is:
\begin{equation}
  g_t(y^{ref}_t \mid x_t, u_t) \propto \exp\left( -\dfrac{1}{2} \vert\vert y^{ref}_t - C_t(u_t)x_t - G_t(u_t) \vert\vert^2_{(D_t(u_t)D_t(u_t)^T)^{-1}}\right)
\end{equation}
and using the standard Kalman recursion discussed in Appendix \ref{sec:KF}, the posterior distribution $p(y^{ref}_t \mid y^{ref}_{t-1}, u_{1:t})$ is given as follows:
\begin{equation}
  p(y^{ref}_t \mid y^{ref}_{t-1}, u_{1:t}) \propto \exp\left( -\dfrac{1}{2} \vert\vert y^{ref}_t - y_{t \mid t-1}(u_{1:t}) \vert\vert^2_{S_t(u_{1:t})^{-1}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $y_{t \mid t-1}$ and $S_t$ are the mean and covariance matrix of the measurement at time $t$ obtained in the Kalman Filter recursions.

By assuming the Markov transition density for $u_t$ to be:
\begin{equation}
  p(u_{t} \mid u_{t-1}) \propto  \exp\left( -\dfrac{1}{2} \vert\vert u_t - u_{t-1} \vert\vert^2_{L_t}\right)
\label{eq:mctrans}
\end{equation}
the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate of $U_{1:T}$ is given to be:
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{u}^*_{1:t} = \arg\max_{u_{1:t}} \pi_n(u_{1:t})
\label{eq:map}
\end{equation}
which essentially specifies the model that best explains the reference $y^{ref}_{1:t}$ as the output sequence from a general set of models defined in \eqref{eq:model}.

In \cite{NK11}, it had been shown that assuming a Markov transition density for $U_t$ in \eqref{eq:mctrans}, the optimal control defined in \eqref{eq:optcontrol} and the MAP estimate defined in \eqref{eq:map} are the same. Moreover, following the monotonicity of the transformation $p(\cdot)^\gamma$, the mode of $p(\cdot)^\gamma$ is the same for all $\gamma > 0$. The main difference is that it is easier to sample closer to the mode when $\gamma > 1$ because the density has sharper peak and vice versa. Putting all these together, we have the follows:
\begin{equation}
  u^*_{1:t} = \tilde{u}^*_{1:t} = \arg\max_{u_{1:t}} \pi_n(u_{1:t})^\gamma,~\gamma > 0
\end{equation}

In SMC algorithm, this can be easily estimated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\hat{u}^*_{1:t} = arg\max_{u_{1:t}} \pi_n(u^{(i)}_{1:t})^\gamma = \arg\max_{u_{1:t}} p(u^{(i)}_{1:t} \mid y^{ref}_{1:t})^\gamma
\end{equation}
As long as the support of the proposal density include the support of $(u^{(i)}_{1:t} \mid y^{ref}_{1:t})$, this estimate converge asymptotically to the $\tilde{u}^*_{1:t}$ as $N \to \infty$. A better estimate can be obtained by embedding the Viterbi strategy as discussed in \cite{SG01}, but this comes with a computational cost that is quadratic in terms of the number of samples.

To add diversity to the population samples, the Resample-Move step (see Section \ref{sec:rm}) can be added. This step perturbs the samples yet leave the distribution the samples represent unchanged by using a MCMC kernel that is invariant in density.

\section{Numerical Example: Tracking a stationary oscillating wave}
\label{sec:exp1}
We first consider here a simple linear Gaussian state space model as follows:
\begin{align}
  X_t &= X_{t-1} + W_t + U_t \nonumber \\
  Y_t &= X_t + V_t
\label{eq:refnmodel}
\end{align}
with $W_t, V_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$. This model is essential an instance of the class of model presented earlier in \eqref{eq:model}, with $A_t=B_t=C_t=D_t=I$, $F_t(U_t)=U_t$ and $G_t(U_t)=0$. The target reference is set to be an oscillating wave: $y^{ref}_t = \cos(0.2 \pi t + 0.3)$ and $L_1$ is set to $0.1$ similar to the setting used in \cite{NK11}.

This model serves two purposes here. Firstly, it is sufficient simple to verify the implementation\footnote{Strictly speaking, testing only increases confidence of the implementation correctness but does not prove no bug.}. Secondly, it serves as good benchmark problem in which we can examine the sensitivity of the algorithm to different parameter settings.

We proceed by examining the proposed algorithm with proposal density $q_t(\cdot)$ set to be the same as the Markov transition density and \emph{all} different combination of settings as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Various time period length settings, $T$: 5, 10 and 20.
\item Various sample size settings, $N$: 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10000.
\item Resampling step: Always vs. Selectively (trigger threshold set to $\frac{\text{ESS}}{2}$).
\item Resample-Move step with MCMC (random walk proposal): Always vs. disabled.
\item Various $\gamma$ settings: Constant function of $1$, $50$, $100$, $1000$ and increasing function of time $t$, $10t$, $50t$ and $100t$.
\end{enumerate}

For each of the setting, the experiment is repeated for $30$ times. Therefore, there are in total $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 2 \times 8 \times 30 = 14400$ runs. 

\subsection{Results and discussion}
This sections presents a summary of the experimental results from all the runs. Instead of presenting the outputs produced by all the runs, only a subset of outputs that demonstrates our findings is presented here. The complete set of implementation code and output produced can be obtained from the repository of this project at \href{https://github.com/yowtzu/mscproj}{GitHub}.

\subsubsection{Selectively resampling step with ESS}
We first evaluate the effect of selectively enabling resample step with ESS mechanism. In \emph{all} the settings, it is found that the simple runs with resample step enabled always at each iteration, i.e., with ESS disabled,  have relatively better performance. Figure \ref{fig:ess} shows the result the performance obtained in terms of $\log\pi_T(\hat{u}^*_{1:t})$ of 30 independent runs of the algorithms with $T=20$ and $N=10000$ for various $\gamma$ settings. All other runs with different settings of $T$ and $N$ concur with this finding. From here onwards, we assumes ESS mechanism is disabled unless stated otherwise.

To explain this counter-intuitive result, recall that ESS is essentially a proxy to measure the quality of the weighted samples in representing the target distribution. A sample set that is well spread over the target distribution would have high ESS value and vice versa. However, the application of SMC as a maximiser here is \emph{only} concerned with the mode of the distribution. The process of resampling the samples proportional to the weights essentially pushes samples towards the mode of the distribution. Selectively resampling using ESS essentially reduces the strength of this push and therefore leads to sub-optimal solution.

\subsubsection{Resample-Move step with MCMC}
In Figure \ref{fig:ess}, we can also observe that the Resample-Move step does improve performance, albeit the improvement is marginal  in most of the cases. The improvement is more significant when $\gamma$ is set to be high. Figures \ref{fig:rm1}, \ref{fig:rm2} and \ref{fig:rm3} show the box plots of $\log\pi_T(\hat{u}^*_{1:t})$ of $30$ independent runs for time period $T$ of 5, 10, 20 respectively. Each sub-figure shows the runs for a selected $\gamma$ setting with the box-plots grouped by whether the Resample-Move step is used (on the left) or not (on the right), sorted in terms of number of samples used $N$.

One possible explanation to this result is that high $\gamma$ settings sharpen the distribution shape. Such a setting encourages optimisation by pushing the sample towards  high density area but at the same time reduces the space exploration. With excessively high $\gamma$ settings, the sample set may be led to a local optimal with relatively high density area, which may not be the mode of the distribution. The perturbation Resample-Move step introduced at each iteration may help particles to escape from local optimal.

    \label{fig:rm3}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Various sample settings}
In terms of the sample size setting used, the performance increased monotonically with the number of samples used for all time periods considered as shown in Figures \ref{fig:rm1}, \ref{fig:rm2} and \ref{fig:rm3}. This is in-line with the theory, more samples is always better. For the shorter time-period considered, says $T=5$, the performance improvement sometimes is ``saturated'' even with lower number of samples, says $T=1000$ or $T=5000$. This suggests the optimal control parameters may have been attained.

 \subsubsection{Various $\gamma$ settings}
A more interesting result is to compare the performance with different $\gamma$ settings. Let first consider the fixed $\gamma$ settings. Excessive high $\gamma$ settings may lead to issue discussed earlier and stuck at local optimal. On the other hand, low $\gamma$ settings also does not perform too well either (consider the process of searching for the mode by randomly sampling a very flat distribution). The optimal $\gamma$ setting seems to lie sometimes in between. In this case, the $\gamma=100$ setting results in the best performance.

In \cite{NK11}, it was suggested that using an increasing $\gamma$ setting may be a good pragmatic compromise between accuracy and good mixing. We investigate further on this by setting $\gamma$ to be increasing function of the form $\alpha t$, where $\alpha$ is constant and $t$ is the time step. The results show that the performance seems improve when the $\alpha$ value is low, but the result is worse when the $\alpha$ value is high. This suggests a capping on the maximum value on $\alpha$ or a more moderate in $t$ may be more suitable. We therefore carry out two extra $\gamma$ settings: $50\log(t+1)$ and $100\log(t+1)$ to investigate this. The results of these runs are shown in Figure \ref{fig:log}. The results obtained are not statistically different from a simple fixed $\gamma=100$ setting.

\end{figure}

Lastly, we conclude this section by showing the mean of the recursive likelihood $m_t(u^*{1:T})$ obtained in various runs in Figure \ref{fig:estimatedy} and their corresponding tracking errors in Figure \ref{fig:error}. The results looks very promising. Except in the runs with the $\gamma=1$ setting in which there is a lot of noise in tracking, all other runs are able to track the reference signal very close.

\chapter{Track the DAX index}

\label{cha:dax}

\section{Example 2: Tracking the DAX Index}
\label{sec:exp2}
%This chapter details the experiments carried out to investigate the potential of the SMC based algorithm to search for the optimal portfolio. It first presents a simple toy example in Section \ref{sec:exp1}, continue on with a more complicated example with real-world data in Section \ref{sec:exp2} and concludes the chapter with an experiment in demonstrating how the concepts Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be incorporated into the framework proposed.
 
%We investigate in this chapter how SMCs can be used to search for the optimal control parameters for portfolio optimisation problem in financial market, i.e., what decision a portfolio manager need to do to minimize the portfolio's tracking error to the target's stock index over a finite time horizon. This chapter is organised as follows: In Section \ref{sec:po}  shows how a portfolio optimisation problem can be re-casted into a parameter estimation problem in SMC framework. Section \ref{sec:toy} details the experiments in accessing how well this approach perform to track various target signals generated by some known models. Section \ref{sec:real} presents the experiments of examining the approach using real-world data collected from Yahoo finance. Section \ref{sec:extension} details possible extensions that can be easily achieved with this framework with some concrete examples. Finally, Section \ref{sec:summary} concludes this chapter with a summary of results.

In this chapter, we attempt to use the algorithm to a real-world example. We look at the German's DAX (Deutscher Aktienindex) Index, which consists of 30 German's blue chip stocks listed on Frankfurt Stock Exchange as the constituents from 1st January 2014 up to 30th June 2014. It represents $80\%$ of the aggregated prime standard's market capitalization. The DAX Index is chosen for various pragmatic reasons. It is one of the major world indices that is tracked by various index funds, it has small number of components and the data is freely accessible\footnote{Actually, we first looked at Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index obtained. It was later found some of the data is not publicly available. Having said that, the preliminary findings concur with the findings we have with the DAX Index reported here.}. For further detail on the DAX Index methodology, refer \cite{DAX14}.
 
\subsection{Tracking the DAX4 sub-index}
In the first experiment, we define a simple hypothetical sub-index, DAX4 consists of four stocks from the DAX Index that have the highest weights as of 2nd January 2014, namely Bayer (BAYN), Siemens (SIE), BASF (BAS) and Daimler (DAI). Then, the DAX4 index level is calculated as the simple weighted average of the adjusted close prices obtained from Yahoo Finance as follows:
\begin{equation}
  y = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} w_s x_s
\end{equation}
where $y$ is the index level, $\mathcal{S}$ consists of the four stocks and  $w_s$ and $x_s$ are the weight and price of stock $s$ respectively. Here the weights of these four stocks are assigned to be $0.4$, $0.3$, $0.2$ and $0.1$ respectively. The adjusted close price of each stock along with the calculated index level are shown in Figure \ref{fig:adjclose}.
 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{adjclose}
\caption{The adjusted close price of the 4 stocks and the calculated DAX4 index level.}
\label{fig:adjclose}
\end{figure}
 
The portfolio optimisation problem is formulated as such $y$ is viewed as the target reference level that a portfolio manager attempt to replicate as close as possible by changing the holding position on each component stocks in $\mathcal{S}$, at the same time, minimize the transaction cost incurred in position changes.
 
To solve this problem using the SMC,  the following state space modelling is used:
\begin{align}
  X_t &= X_{t-1} + F_t(U_t) + \mu_{t_0} + \Sigma_{t_0} \\
  Y_t &= U^T_tX_t + 0.1V_t,~V_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
\end{align}
where $\{X_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ is a vector of stock price processes modelled as Arithmetic Brownian Motion with drift, $\{U_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ is a vector of control input processes, each represents the position we have for each stock, $F_t(u_t)$ can be viewed as the market impact on price due to position changes and is set to be $0.1u_t$ here, $\mu_{t_0}$ and $\Sigma_{t_0}$ are vector of the estimated mean and the estimated covariance matrix of the stock returns and $\{Y_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ is the process represents the index level. The values of $\mu_t$ and $\Sigma_t$ here are estimated using Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) approach with the decay rate, $\lambda$, set to $0.94$, which can be easily calculated in a recursion form as follows:
\begin{equation}
  P_t = \lambda P_{t-1} + (1-\lambda) Q_{t}
\end{equation}
where $P_t$ is the EWMA estimate and $Q_t$ is the new observation at time step $t$. It is obvious from these equations that the EWMA estimate at time $t$ depends on all the preceding estimates at time $s$, where $s < t$. To ensure the quality of EWMA estimate, a 6 months warm up period is used, i.e., the EWMA estimate is calculated from 1st July 2013 onwards. The estimates of $\mu_{t_0}$ and $\Sigma_{t_0}$ obtained are as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{t_0} =
\begin{blockarray}{c}
\\
\begin{block}{(c)}
~ 0.00049655 ~ \\
0.00215094 \\
0.00156870 \\
0.00203186 \\
\end{block}
\end{blockarray}
~\Sigma_{t_0} =
\begin{blockarray}{ccccc}
  BAYN & SIE & BAS & DAI & \\
\begin{block}{(cccc)c}
 ~ 0.00011122 & 0.00009616 & 0.00010233 & 0.00009828 ~ & BAYN \\
0.00009616 & 0.00013975 & 0.00010037 & 0.00008377 ~ & SIE \\
0.00010233 & 0.00010037 & 0.00014317 & 0.00010481 & BAS \\
0.00009828 & 0.00008377 & 0.00010481 & 0.00013398 & DAI \\
\end{block}
\end{blockarray}
\end{equation}
 
It is worth here to re-iterate here that this model is just a means to an end to demonstrate the idea. Other sophisticated models, e.g., Geometric Brownian Motion with drift, Jump diffusion model, etc., are possible, perhaps better. This model is again an instance of the model class defined in \eqref{eq:model}.

Using this model, we can write the reward function as follows:
\begin{equation}
  J(u_{1:T},y^{ref}_{1:T}, x_0) = \E_{x_0}\left[ -\dfrac{1}{2}\displaystyle\sum^T_{t=1}\left(\vert\vert y^{ref}_t - C_t(u_t)x_t \vert\vert^2_{(D_t(u_t)D_t(u_t)^T)^{-1}}  + \vert\vert u_t - u_{t-1} \vert\vert^2_{L_t}\right) \right]
\end{equation}
Here, we will define $L = 0.1\diag(4,3,2,1)$ and also impose additional constraints on each component of $u$ is in the range $[0,0.5]$. The idea behind these choices is to construct a scenario in which there is different amount of transaction cost involved in changing positions on each component and a constraint on the maximum amount on each component one portfolio can have. This time, we will use the SMC algorithm to target $\pi$ directly, i.e, fixed $\gamma=1$ setting. For the importance sampling step, $U_{1,n}$ is sampled uniformly from the range bounded the constraints mentioned. 

\subsubsection{Results and discussion}
The simulation is carried out for $N=10000$ with no resample-move step implemented and the results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:dax4}. The output $y$ produced by the model using the estimated $\hat{u}^*_{1:T}$ is tracking the reference index level very close with the average annualised\footnote{the annualisation factor is set to be $\sqrt{252}$ as the daily return is measured here.} tracking error of $0.024570$ over the $30$ runs tracking error. However, the estimated set of control parameter $\hat{u}^*_{1:T}$ which represents the holding position of each stock is not very stable.

\begin{figure}[tbp]

\label{fig:dax4}
\end{figure}

To reduce the number of changes in holding positions, the value of $L$ matrix can be scaled up. To demonstrate this, the same experiment is re-run with $L = 500\diag(4,3,2,1)$. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:dax42}. It is obvious the estimated set of control parameters $\hat{u}^*_{0:T}$ produced in this case is much more stable. However, this comes with a price on the tracking error. The average annualised tracking error with this setting is increased to $0.041328$ over the $30$ runs.

\label{fig:dax42}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tracking the DAX index}
Given the results look promising, we attempt to track the original DAX index which consists of $30$ components using the similar model with minimal changes as follows:
\begin{align}
  X_t &= X_{t-1} + F_t(U_t) + \mu_{t_0} + \Sigma_{t_0} \\
  Y_t &= 30U^T_tX_t + 0.1V_t,~V_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
\end{align}
with the same parameter settings as before except the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The target reference $y^{ref}$ is the daily close level of the DAX index.
\item Dimensionality of $U$ and $X$ are increased from $4$ to $30$.
\item The $L$ matrix is set to be $50I_{30 \times 30}$, i.e., the transaction cost of each component is equal.
\end{enumerate}

As mentioned, sometimes it can be more efficient (not only in terms of computational), but also in terms of transaction cost and management perspective to the index with only a subset of its constituents.

This can be achieved with minimal change on the model proposed. We choose the top $6$ highest weighted constituents of DAX index by including Allianz SE ($ALV$) and SAP SE ($SAP$), in which they all together constitute more than $50\%$ of the weights for the DAX index level as of 2nd January 2014. Using only these $6$ component stocks, $L=50I_{6 \times 6}$ and the DAX index level as the target reference $y^{ref}$, the experiment is re-run for $30$ times.

\subsubsection{Results and discussion}
As before, the estimated $\hat{u}^*_{0:T}$ and the corresponding $y$ output of the model produced by the estimated $\hat{u}^*_{0:T}$ in one of the $15$ independent runs for full and partial replication are shown in Figure \ref{fig:dax} and \ref{fig:daxpartial} respectively.

In the full replication case, the average annuualised tracking error over $30$ runs is $0.031669$. However, the computational cost increases significantly in this experiment due to the dimensionality increases in $U$ and $X$. Using the computation cost of the previous $DAX4$ experiment as the baseline model, the computational cost for this experiment is $\approx 7.2$ times more for each iteration.

In the partial replication case, the average annualised tracking error over $30$ runs is $0.020375$. In terms of computational cost, the relative cost factor in comparison to the baseline is $\approx 1.1$. In other words, this setting is $6.5\times$ speed-up in comparison to the full replication setting.

\section{Model Predictive Control}
Up to this point, the discussion has been focussed on predicting the optimal (as outlined in the reward function) strategy for the time period $0:T$. However, as time progress, there are more realisation of the reference signal $y^{ref}_{t^\prime}, t^\prime < T$ obtained. It makes sense to take this information into account in the optimisation process. In this section, we shall demonstrate how the Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm can be incorporated easily for this problem.

MPC is an established technique in control theory which has achieved significant success in many different domains. It is a kind of receding horizon control algorithm, in which at time step $t$, the model is used to optimise the controls for the process, $u_{t:t+W}$ for a finite horizon for $t:t+W$. However, only the first set of controls, i.e., $u_{t}$ is applied to the system. At time $t+1$, the whole optimisation process is repeated for the same horizon, but shifted by $1$ time step until $t=T$. Refer \cite{GCE89} for further details on MPC. 

In this problem, the SMC algorithm can be executed on a daily basis after the market close on day $t$ to predict the optimal $u^*_{t:t+T}$, i.e., $W=T$, but only the first set of controls, $u_t$ is applied. The same SMC algorithm is repeated on the next day with a shifted time horizon and so on. To demonstrate this idea, we repeat the same experiment on the DAX index with partial replication using $6$ components with the highest weights as before.

The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:mpc}. We can see a significant improvement of performance with only tracking error of $0.020308$ over the $15$ runs. Having said that, the computational requirement here is \emph{much} higher. Whilst the cost of each iteration remains the same, for a finite horizon, there is $WT$ iterations as opposed to $T$ iterations.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion5}
This chapter presents some proof-of-concept experiments that have been
carried out to validate our proposal: searching for the optimal control for a portfolio to track a target reference signal using SMC algorithms. It first presents an experiment with a oscillating wave as target reference signal and continues with an experiment with a major real-world index as target reference signal. In all cases, the results show that SMC techniques are able to search for optimal control that results an output that is able to track the reference signal.
