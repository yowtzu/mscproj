  As computer system size and complexity grow, formulating effective
  policies require more sophistication. There are many risk factors
  need to be considered, some of which may be in conflict.
  Inevitably, unpredictable circumstances that demand decisions will
  arise during operation. In some cases an automated response may be
  imperative; in other cases these may be ill-advised.  Manual
  decisions made to override the default ones, in a sense, redefining
  the underlying policy. This matter is further complicated in highly
  dynamic operational environments like mobile ad-hoc networks, in
  which the risk factors may be changing continually. Thus, security
  policies must be able to change and adapt to the operational needs.

  This study investigates the potential of evolutionary algorithms as
  a tool in determining the optimal security policies that suit such
  environments. This thesis reviews some fundamental concepts in
  related domains. It presents three applications of evolutionary
  algorithms in solving problems that are of direct relevance. These
  include the inference of security policies from decision examples,
  the dynamic adaptation of security policies and the optimisation of
  security policies for a specific set of missions. The results show
  that the inference approaches based on evolutionary algorithms are
  very promising. These approaches are also sufficiently generic to be
  used as general dynamic classification algorithms.

  The thesis concludes with an evaluation on the work done, the extent
  to which the work justify the thesis hypothesis and some possible
  directions on how evolutionary algorithms can be applied to address
  a wider range of relevant problems on the domain of concern.
