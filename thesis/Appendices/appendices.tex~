In a conditional linear Gaussian state space as follows:
\begin{align}
  X_t &= A_t(U_t)X_{t-1} + B_t(U_t)W_t + F_t(U_t) \nonumber \\
  Y_t &= C_t(U_t)X_t + D_t(U_t)V_t + G_t(U_t)
\label{eq:gaussianmodel}
\end{align}
where $\{U_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ is a deterministic control input sequence that is used regulate the hidden states, $A_t$, $B_t$, $C_t$, $D_t$, $F_t$, $G_t$ are appropriate matrix/vector functio\
ns of $U_n$ and  $\{W_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ and  $\{V_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ are independent sequences of standard Gaussian random variable, i.e., $W_t, V_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$, the transition densi\
ty and likelihood of this model are Gaussian distributions with center lied at a point of a linear combination of the known conditional control parameters, $u_t$ of the following form:
\begin{align}
  p_t(u_t \mid u_{t-1}) &= \textrm{(any given form)} \nonumber \\
  f_t(x_t \mid x_{t-1}, u_t) &= \mathcal{N}(A_t(u_t) x_{t-1} + F_t(u_t), B_t(u_t)B_t(u_t)^T) \nonumber \\
  g_t(y_t \mid x_t, u_t)    &= \mathcal{N}(C_t(u_t) x_t + G_t(u_t), D_t(u_t)D_t(u_t)^T)
\end{align}

Using the properties of Gaussian distribution, the integral involved can be resolved analytically. This leads to the widely used \emph{Kalman Filter} \cite{KRE60} that has the following recursive solution as follows:
\begin{align}
  \mu_{t \mid t -1} &= A_{t}(u_t)(\mu_{t-1 \mid t-1})X_{t-1} + F_t(u_t) \\
  \Sigma_{t \mid t -1} &= A_{t}(u_t)\Sigma_{t -1 \mid t -1}A_{t}(u_t)^T +  B_t(u_t)B_t(u_t)^T \\
  S_t &=  C_{t}(u_t)\Sigma_{t \mid t -1}C_{t}(u_t)^T +  D_t(u_t)D_t(u_t)^T \\
  m_{t \mid t-1} &=  C_{t}(u_t)  \mu_{t \mid t-1} + G_t(u_t) \\
  \mu_{t \mid t} &=   \mu_{t \mid t -1} +   \Sigma_{t \mid t -1} C_{t}(u_t)S_t^{-1}(y_t - m_{t \mid t-1}) \\
  \Sigma_{t \mid t} &=  \Sigma_{t \mid t -1} -\Sigma_{t \mid t -1} C_{t}(u_t)S_t^{-1} C_{t}(u_t)\Sigma_{t \mid t -1}
\end{align}
where  $\mu_{t \mid t -1}$ and $\Sigma_{t \mid t -1}$ are the predicted mean and co-variance matrix of the state $x_t$, $m_{t \mid t-1}$ and $S_t$ are the mean and co-variance matrix of th\
e measurement at time $t$ and $\mu_{t \mid t}$ and $\Sigma_{t \mid t}$ are the estimated mean and co-variance matrix of the state $x_t$ after seeing the observation $y_t$.

There are various extensions have been developed on top of this approach. For example, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which uses Taylor Series expansion to linearise at the conditional v\
ariables locally \cite{WG95}, Unscented Kalman Filter which further extend the idea in EKF by only using a minimal set of well chosen samples \cite{EW01}, etc.
