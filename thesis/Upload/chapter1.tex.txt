\label{Introduction}
Security is intrinsically concerned with risk; however in current
practice, security is managed in terms of fixed, rigid security
policies. There is a growing acceptance that the current security
mechanisms are not appropriate for future network systems, for
example, mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). This problem has recently
received increasing attention in the research community.

Current security policy development often begins with a set of
high-level rules that capture the security goals and then looks at the
policy refinement problem. There is a pre-determined notion of risk
management encoded in the security policy. However, formulating an
optimal security policy in itself is difficult as there are many
factors which need to be considered, some of which are in
conflict. Often, the tradeoffs among these factors are made by the
security administrators based on their experiences and intuitions.

The interaction between the security administrators and the decision
makers is often able to elicit, at best, a partial description of
security policy. These stakeholders may well be able to give specific
decisions to specific instances of authorisation requests but not
always be adept at generalising these decisions to a security policy,
especially when the complexities of MANETs are taken into account. The
matter is further complicated by the fact that the operational benefit
as well as risk must eventually be taken into account. It is very
useful to be able to codify what a ``principled basis'' consists of
since this serves to document ``good practice'' and facilities its
propagation. There is currently no coherent way forward on this
issue. Ideally, what we need are techniques that allow security policy
elicitation from examples in a principled manner. Thus we ask the
question: can techniques be found to allow inference of security
policy?

Inevitably, unpredictable circumstances will arise that demand
decisions during operational time. In some cases an automated response
may be imperative; in other cases these may be ill advised. Manual
decisions made to override the default ones, in a sense, redefine the
underlying policy. This matter is further complicated in a highly
dynamic operational environment like MANETs, where the risk factors
are constantly changing. A new requirement is thus needed in security
policy: the security policy has to be able to change and adapt to the
operational needs. The current approach to this problem is the manual
creation of exceptions to policies by granting the required permission
to the users to meet operational needs. This process can be tedious
and time consuming. Worse, the exceptions granted are often never
revoked when they should be. Sometimes, information is also classified
at a lower sensitivity level to facilitate information sharing. The
security policy is thus being tweaked and used in such a way as to fit
the operational needs. A more principled and conceptually clear
approach taking this requirement into account would therefore be
advantageous.

The security requirements may differ on a case-by-case basis. Recent
research \cite{JPO04} has provide excellent articulation of why
pre-canned one-size-fits-all security policies and mechanisms are
inappropriate to many modern day operations. Many more abstract
frameworks for the access control system are being proposed to cope
with the realities of modern systems. An example of these is the
risk-budget based approach. In this approach, users are given risk
budgets that they can spend to access information. Riskier accesses
cost more. Such approaches raise several issues: what initial budgets
should be given?  Should we allow an unfettered free market?  If not,
then what constraints should we impose? Should there be minimum costs
associated with specific accesses?

We can see that the risk-budget based approach is not a single policy;
it is really a policy family. Each policy instance constrains
operations in its own way and affects operational behaviour and
effectiveness. The question arises: for a specific mission (with all
its nuances and characteristics), which of this vast family of
policies will lead to the best overall results? Currently there is no
way of knowing. Such a policy must be \emph{found} rather than
specified without investigation and finding a policy would appear
to be a computationally hard task.

This problem resonates elsewhere. Current governments use
macroeconomic levers (such as setting interest and taxation rates) to
achieve overall economic goals. The economy is a complex system with
emergent properties and there is often no agreement amongst economists
about the consequences of particular choices of system parameters.
Different countries also have different sorts of economy: there is no
one policy fit for all. This is precisely the situation we are in for
military operations. The goals and capabilities of organizations and
missions will vary, as will capabilities and staffing
characteristics. Why would we expect a one-size-fits-all security
policy to satisfy our needs and which allows us to make appropriate
risk decisions in all cases? Parts of a given security policy may
apply across settings but some notion of mission or organizational
specificity needs to be taken into account. We observe that it may be
difficult to determine the effect a particular economics based policy
may have on attaining mission goals.

As an alternative scenario, consider the proliferation of social
networking websites and the privacy issues that arise with regards to
the information published. Coming up with a default privacy policy to
suit all users is inherently difficult; yet simply providing fine
grained controls that allow users to set their preferences is neither
sufficient nor realistic to solve the problem either \cite{JB09}. The
process of specifying who is allowed to access which information can
be cumbersome and becomes a usability nightmare. Consequently, users
are unlikely to use these privacy controls even if they are made
available to them. As discussed earlier, the task is difficult and not
straightforward. Even if the users were dedicated in spending time to
set up their custom privacy policy, they might not be adept in doing
so.

A recent proposal \cite{JB09} to overcome these problems is to have
pre-packaged privacy policies, designed by experts, so users can
choose whichever suits them best. We attempt push this idea one step
further, and propose to automatically \emph{discover} these
pre-packaged policies. This shifts the emphasis away from specifying
and refining a one-size-fits-all policy towards searching a policy
that has beneficial and acceptable outcomes from a family of
policies. We believe this is entirely novel.

\section{Thesis Hypothesis and Contributions}
\label{ThesisHypothesisAndContribution}
%This thesis aims to explore the possibility of using evolutionary
%algorithms to infer the near optimal security policy prior to deployment and
%during operation of mobile ad-hoc network systems. The inferred
%policy has to be dynamic such that it can detect and respond to the
%changes in the operational environment in real-time to maintain its
%optimality.
In this thesis, we seek the means to determine an optimal, or at least
execellent, policy for initial system configuration and also the
means to adapt it in the light of changing circumstances using
evolutionary algorithms (EAs).

EAs are heuristic optimisation techniques that draw loose inspiration
of the natural selection process from the biological world. The
optimisation process is guided by a fitness function that measures the
success of a particular solution to the problem in question. Many
systems have been built using EAs and these systems often outperform
those designed with the traditional techniques. Additionally, EAs make
very weak assumptions on the solution space and therefore have the
ability to search for solutions of unknown (or controlled) size and
shape in vast, discontinuous solution spaces. If EAs are found to be
feasible to infer policies, other techniques that impose more
assumptions and constraints are deemed to be able to achieve
comparable, if not better performance.

Formally, the hypothesis of the thesis is stated as follows:
\begin{quote}
  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have the potential to be an effective 
  means of determining the security policies that suit challenging
  environments, as typified by mobile ac-hoc networks (MANETs).
\end{quote}
By effective we mean the ability to determine an optimal or near
optimal security policy that fits the needs of the mission in its
operational
environment. %By efficient we mean the ability to determine the
%effective security policy before it becomes obsolete due to the
%changes in operational needs.

In this thesis, I demonstrate:
\begin{itemize}
\item how EAs can be used to infer static security
  policies from a set of decision examples. Three different ways of
  representing security policies and two different EAs are investigated. In all cases, the results show that
  this idea is feasible.
\item how the fuzzy set concept can be integrated into the policy
  inference framework to improve the policy inference performance. The
  idea is sufficiently generic to be applied to other classification
  problems, provided that there is a partial ordering among the
  classes.
%\item Design a dynamic security policy model. Currently there are no
%  available decision examples that change with time for us to work
%  with. This model is designed to generate such decision examples
%  which can be used for training as well as evaluation purposes.
\item how multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can be used
  to infer dynamic security policies from a set of decision
  examples. Two novel dynamic learning frameworks based upon MOEAs are
  developed and both are sufficiently generic to be used as general
  dynamic classification algorithms.
\item how EAs can be used to infer the (near) optimal policies that
  fits a specific mission (or at least a specific family of
  missions).%, instead of a one-size-fits-all general notion of policy.
\item how MOEAs can be used to infer a set of Pareto optimal policies.
\item how simulation runs can be used in place of a set of decision
  examples to provide feedback in evaluating the fitness of a policy
  with respect to the specified high level objectives.
\item how the Pareto front of the security policies discovered using
  MOEAs can reveal useful information about the relationship among
  different objectives, which may be difficult to obtain
  otherwise. Such information provides useful insight for
  policy makers to select and apply the optimal policy that fits the
  needs of current operational environment on a case-by-case basis.
%\item how evolved policies can reveal useful information on the
%  relationship among different decision factors. This information is
%  useful for policy makers to verify, improve or even replace the
%  existing policy if necessary depending on circumstances.
\end{itemize}

The subsequent chapters of this thesis are organized as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Chapter \ref{ComputerSecurity}] presents the fundamental
  computer security concepts which are related to this thesis. It
  begins with a brief introduction to the security objective and the
  security risk analysis. It then presents the concept of dynamic
  coalitions, with an emphasis placed on MANETs and the challenges
  they impose on the current security mechanism.
\item[Chapter \ref{SecurityPolicyModels}] firstly reviews the
  traditionally influential security policies and models. It then
  presents some recently proposed risk-budget based models which aim
  to provide more flexibility and the top-down policy hierarchical
  development model which enables policy composition and
  refinement. The chapter concludes with the research issues in the
  security policy development which we will attempt to answer.
% \item[Chapter \ref{SecurityPolicyAndAccessControl}] reviews how
%   risk are being used to guide the decision making process. It first
%   presents the FuzzyMLS model, a flexible risk based security policy
%   model by applying the fuzzy logic concepts on the traditional multi
%   level security (MLS) system. Next, it presents the JASON risk budget
%   based security policy model which shows how risk in accessing
%   information can be managed and distributed across organizations
%   using economy concepts. Lastly, it reviews some commmon web based
%   reputation systems which show how reputation can be used to estimate
%   the risk to guide decision making process.
\item[Chapter \ref{LearningTechniques}] introduces the learning
  techniques used in this thesis. The first part introduces EAs ---

  Grammatical Evolution (GE). The second part introduces the fuzzy
  expert systems.
\item[Chapter \ref{StaticSecurityPolicyInference}] details the
  experiments in using EAs to infer static security policies inference
  from a set of training decision examples. Three different ways of
