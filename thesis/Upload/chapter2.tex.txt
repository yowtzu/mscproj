\label{ComputerSecurity}
Security is about the protection of assets against threats
\cite{CPP02}. This definition implies that we need to know what assets
require protection. As computer systems have evolved, the nature of
specific assets and threats has changed \cite{RL06}. Prior to the
invention of the personal computer, computer security was mainly
concerned with the protection of computer mainframes. Here, particular
threats could be countered by simple physical controls. Thus, a
mainframe could be stored in a room with effective physical access
controls to prevent unauthorised access and appropriate levels of
control over the surrounding physical environment, e.g., provision of
non-stop temperature controls.

In recent years, computer and network hardware has grown cheaper;
using a computer has now become commonplace. Individuals use computers
to store their private information, e.g., credit card numbers, bank
account passwords, private diary, etc. Organizations use computers to
increase their operational efficiency. There is an increasing amount
of valuable information stored in computers. The sheer ubiquity of
valuable information means that its security is an issue for us
all.

%Consequently, computer security implies protection of the
%information stored in computer systems.

% A term that is often confused with computer security is information
% security. Information security is defined as the process used to
% protect information assets from threats including deliberate or
% inadvertent unauthorised acquisition, damage, disclosure,
% manipulation, modification, loss, or use \cite{GM94}.

This chapter presents the fundamental computer security concepts
related to this thesis. It begins with a brief introduction to the
common security objectives and the security risk analysis. It then
presents the concept of dynamic coalitions, with an emphasis placed on
the mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and the challenges they impose.

\section{Computer Security Objectives}
\label{ComputerSecurityObjectives}
Traditionally, the objectives of computer security are commonly
summarised as confidentiality, integrity and availability, which often
collectively known as the C-I-A triad \cite{RL06}. Over time, many
security practitioners have realised the incompleteness of the triad
and attempted to augment it with new objectives. These objectives
include authenticity, accountability and non-repudiation. In
\cite{DBP98}, Donn B. Parker introduced the Parkerian hexad, which
adds three more objectives to the C-I-A triad: possession (control);
authenticity; and utility.

The following sections briefly summarise each of these objectives and
their established scopes respectively. For extensive discussion, refer
\cite{DG05, RJA01, MB02}.

\subsection{Confidentiality}
\label{Confidentiality}
Confidentiality is concerned with the protection of information from
unauthorised \emph{disclosure}. In computer systems, confidentiality
is about preventing unauthorised subjects from \emph{reading}
information. Confidentiality is often confused with the terms:
``secrecy'' and ``privacy''. Gollmann clarifies these terms in
\cite{DG05}. He views both secrecy and privacy as forms of
confidentiality. Whilst privacy is concerned with the confidentiality
of personal data, secrecy is concerned with the confidentiality of
organization data. For example, a privacy violation happens when an
organization shares the personal information of its customers with
other organizations without the knowledge of the customers.

Sometimes, it is necessary to protect the confidentiality of the
subject identities on top of the confidentiality. This is more often
known as anonymity. More formally, anonymity is the state in which a
subject's true identity remains unknown by other subjects
\cite{AP01}. An example to show why anonymity is necessary is traffic
analysis attack \cite{DG05}. The attackers can derive information
such as the relationship between the parties from patterns in
communication, even when messages are encrypted. In order to preserve
the anonymity of the subject identities, there needs to be a property
of unlinkability between identities of the participants and the
communication.

\subsection{Integrity}
\label{Integrity}
In computer security, integrity is concerned with the protection of
assets from unauthorised \emph{modification} \cite{DG05} as opposed to
``the quality of having strong moral principles'' defined in the
Oxford Dictionary of English \cite{CS05}. In computer systems,
integrity is about preventing unauthorised subjects from
\emph{writing} information. For this reason, integrity is sometimes
perceived as the dual of confidentiality and similar techniques can be
expected to be used in achieving this objective, e.g., the Biba
security model \cite{KJB77} has the mirror properties of the
Bell-LaPadula security model \cite{DEB73}.

Further interpretations and constraints on what integrity implies have
also been made in the literature. Clark and Wilson argued that the
usage of a data modification method, which causes data loss or
corruption, should not be permitted even by an authorised subject
\cite{DDC87}. The integrity requirement is split into two parts:
internal and external consistency. Whilst internal consistency is
concerned with ensuring the consistency of internal data in the
computer systems, external consistency is concerned with ensuring that
the internal data reflects the data which it represents in the real
world. The Clark-Wilson definition is more sophisticated and reflects
the subtleties present in the commercial environment. On the other
hand, the definition of integrity given in the Trusted Computer System
Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) is concerned only with external
consistency; integrity is defined as ``the state that exists when
computerised data is the same as the source documents and has not been
exposed to accidental or malicious alteration or destruction''
\cite{DOD85}.

\subsection{Availability}
\label{Availability}
Availability is concerned with the likelihood of a system's ability to
provide some services. In particular, the availability at time $t$,
usually denoted by $A(t)$, is the probability that the system can
provide a specific service at time $t$ under stated conditions
\cite{REB75}.

Availability may be compromised by a variety of mechanisms. A simple
example is hardware failure. Traditionally, the threat from such
failure is countered by the use of redundancy \cite{AB01}. Redundancy
can be made in two forms: either the redundant components act as
backups that are activated should one component fail, or all duplicate
components run concurrently and form a voting system, in which the
consensus output is the majority vote. Denial of service (DoS)
attacks, which aim to make a system unavailable to the authorised
users, may take many forms. At one extreme, an army of compromised
hosts may be used to clog up a large network by wide-scale consumption
of resources. At the other, a smart attacker may target a specific
server aiming only to issue service requests at the rate they are
dispatched (but in a manner than keeps the service requests queue
full, and hence unavailable).

% For example, an attacker can flood a file
% server with requests to prevent other users from using the

\subsection{Accountability and Non-repudiation}
\label{AccountabilityAndNonrepudiation}
The security objectives discussed so far have sought to prevent
unwanted events from happening. What if these preventions fail?
Accountability attempts to answer this by ensuring the actions which
affect security can be traced to the responsible subject \cite{DG05}.
In other words, accountability attempts to establish the links between
the subjects and the actions made. This conflicts with anonymity which
strives to unlink them. A common way to achieve accountability is to
keep a secure audit trail on the systems. Illicit modification or
deletion of an audit trail would clearly compromise accountability. A
``denial of service'' attack on audit server provides an alternative
and possibly easier way to achieve the same goal.

Non-repudiation is a stronger form of accountability. Non-repudiation
is concerned with the ability to ensure that a subject is unable to
deny carrying out the action \cite{DG05}. This objective is commonly
achieved with the use of digital signatures. In signing a piece of
data with a private key, a unforgettable binding is established between
the subject and the data. Disclosure of a private key would clearly
compromise any claims to legitimacy of binding \cite{DG05}. Thus,
users must keep their private keys secure.

\subsection{Authenticity}%, Possesion and Utility}
\label{Authenticity}
Authenticity is concerned with the genuineness of the identity a
subject claims to be.  Something is said to be authentic when it
really is what it claims to be. Authentication is the verification of
such claims \cite{MB02}. We may be interested in verifying that the
user at a terminal is who he claims to be. This is personal identity
authentication. In many security protocols, received messages may seem
to be recently created. However, we know that messages can be recorded
and replayed and thus it is often required to verify any such claims
to recency. This is a form of message authentication. Often, we may
also wish to verify the sender identity of a received message, e.g.,
the sender of an email that requests for a bank statement.


There are a great many means of authenticating the identity of a
person. This can be loosely categorised into three groups as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Something the user has (e.g., token card).
 \item Something the user knows (e.g., password, pin, signature).
 \item Something the user is (giving rise to biometrics such as
   fingerprints, iris patterns, and various behavioural
   characteristics such as dynamic signature properties).
\end{enumerate}
An example of authenticity violation is an attacker logging in as an
ordinary user using a stolen password.

Authentication is clearly a prerequisite for many other aspects of
security. Access control is used to dictate the access given to
subjects in regards to specific objects. However, it makes the
assumption that the subject in question really is the person concerned
or it acts legitimately on that person's behalf (e.g., a process
started by that user).

% Authenticity concerns about verification of identity of a subject claimed to be \cite{XX}. For human subjects, the authentication factors can be grouped into three categories as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item something the user has (e.g., token card)
%  \item something the user knows (e.g., password)
%  \item something the user is (e.g., biometric, signature).
% \end{enumerate}
% An example of violation is the attacker login as an ordinary user or administrator of a system using stolen password. Often, authentication is associated with authorisation, but they are different. Authentication concerns with the verification of identity claimed (who a user is); authorization concerns with the privilege a authenticated user has (what a user can do) in the systems \cite{XX}. Therefore, authentication forms the prerequisite of authorization. Sometimes, we also concerns about data origin authentication. This involves the use of cryptographic methods such as digital signatureand challenge response protocols \ref{sec:cryptography}.

% Possession concerns about having control on the information \cite{XX}. An example of violation is the lose of portable computer which contains encrypted confidential data. Although the data of the laptop remains to be confidential and integral, the owner of the laptop has lose the possesion or control on the information in the laptop.

% Utility concerns about the usefulness of the information \cite{XX}. An example of violation is the lose of decryption key on encrypted data. Eventhough the data remains to be confidential, integral and available, the data is not useful as no information can be retrieved from it anymore. These two objectives are closely related to availability because the lose of either one would often leads to unavailability of the information.

\subsection{Summary}
\label{ComputerSecurityObjectives.SectionSummary}
The security objectives discussed in the section can be summarised as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Confidentiality --- prevention of unauthorised disclosure of
  information.
 \item Integrity --- prevention of unauthorised modification of
   information.
 \item Availability --- prevention of the denial of service.
 \item Authenticity --- verification of identity one claims to be.
 \item Accountability and non-repudiation --- prevention of the denial
   of action made.
% \item Possession and Utility - the control and the usefulness of information. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Security Risk Analysis}
\label{SecurityRiskAnalysis}
Security risk analysis (or sometimes referred to as security risk
assessment) is the process to ensure that the security of a system is
commensurate with the risk it is exposed to \cite{DG05}. All
protection measures come at a price. Security risk analysis provides a
means to justify the tradeoff between cost and benefit for security
controls implemented. Despite the various methodologies in conducting
security risk analysis and some of them being tailored to a particular
discussion \cite{CPP02}, they all share a common framework as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assets, vulnerabilities and threats identification
\item Risk assessment
\item Selection of controls
\item Reevaluation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assets, Vulnerabilities and Threats Identification}
\label{AssetVulnerabilitiesAndThreatsIdentification}
Assets are resources that have values in the systems
\cite{RL06}. Assets in computer systems can be mainly categorised into
three groups: hardware, software and information. At times, the
workforce and the reputation of a company are considered as part of
the assets \cite{DG05}. To do risk assessment, all assets are first
identified and their values are evaluated. Whilst the values of
tangible assets (e.g., hardware) are easy to be quantified by
considering the monetary replacement cost, the values of intangible
assets (e.g., software and information) are difficult to estimate. For
example, the loss of confidential information on suppliers and clients
can cause losses to the reputation of the company and business
opportunities. In addition, any damage to the assets in the above
categories can cause damage to the quality of service. One possible
way to estimate the values of these assets is based upon their
importance \cite{HRC06}.

Vulnerabilities are the weaknesses of a system. Attackers attempt to
discover the vulnerabilities of a system in order to cause damage to
assets, either accidentally or intentionally
\cite{DG05}. Vulnerabilities can exist at different levels and places
in a computer system, e.g., operational environments, operating
systems, application software, networks, communication media and
operational practices.

Threats are the potential actions that can be used by attackers to
exploit vulnerabilities in order to cause damage to assets
\cite{CC05}. Threats are posted by threat agents, which can be both
internal and external to the systems. Examples of threat agents can be
hackers, system administrators or viruses which exploit the bugs in a
software to launch attacks on a system. In the literature, the term
``threat'' is often used where the term ``threat agent'' should be. An
extreme example is the definition of threat as ``the party with the
capabilities and intentions to exploit a vulnerability in an asset''
in \cite{RB06}.

The relationship between these terms is best illustrated by the
following example. In a computer network, a possible vulnerability is
the use of default password at the network router (asset). A hacker
(threat agent) can exploit this vulnerability and launch a denial of
service attack to prevent authorised computers from connecting to the
network.

\subsection{Risk Assessment}
\label{RiskAssessment}
The definition of risk varies much in the literature depending on its
application domains. For example, risk can be the standard deviation
on the return of an investment in finance \cite{CRH06}, or risk can
be a function on the amount of losses and the probability of the
losses \cite{PCC07, PCC07A}. Nevertheless, there is a common theme
behind these definitions. Risk is always related to expected losses
which can be caused by an action and the estimated probability of
loss.

In security, risk is defined as a function of assets, vulnerabilities
and threats \cite{DG05}. This definition is coherent with the
engineering definition of risk by considering the amount of losses as
a function of the assets and vulnerabilities in the system. Based on
this definition, the risk assessment of a computer system can be
carried out quantitatively or qualitatively \cite{DG05}.

In quantitative assessment, the values are calculated using
mathematics theories and formulae \cite{CA05}. For example, risk is
calculated based on the monetary replacement values of assets and
probabilities of the likelihood of threats. The advantage of this
analysis is that it provides a precise numerical risk value which is
useful for cost-benefit analysis of recommended controls
\cite{CA05}. However, the precise meaning that a given numerical risk
value represents can become unclear, e.g., a high risk value can be
due to the high value of the asset or the high probability of loss or
both factors. This may cause problem in selecting suitable controls to
protect the system assets because each different system assets may
require different protection mechanisms.

On the contrary, the qualitative assessment uses descriptive variables
to represent risk \cite{CA05}. For example, an asset is given a value
on a scale of cheap, medium and expensive; criticality of
vulnerabilities is given a value on a scale of very low, low, medium,
high and very high; and threats is given a value on a scale of very
low chance, low chance, medium chance, high chance and very high
chance. The mapping of these values to the risk can be obtained by
using a mapping table based on the advices of security experts
\cite{HRC06}. There are also other qualitative analysis techniques,
including scenario analysis and questionnaires \cite{DG05}. The
advantages and disadvantages of using qualitative analysis are more or
less the mirror of using quantitative analysis. This analysis provides
a means to identify the vulnerabilities of the systems in a relatively
short time \cite{DG05}. However, the cost-benefit analysis of
recommended controls becomes difficult in the absence of a precise
numerical risk value \cite{DG05}.

\subsection{Selection of Controls}
\label{SelectionOfControls}
Controls (also known as countermeasures) are the ways to protect a
system against threats. The controls selected must be commensurate
with the risk identified. Controls for the computer systems can be
categorised into three types: administrative, physical and logical.

Administrative controls are concerned with the relationship between
security and human factors \cite{RHL02}. Administrative controls
specify how a system can be used. Examples of administrative controls
include organizational security policies, user registration processes,
business continuity plans, disaster recovery plans, etc. For example,
the computing service in a university defines the security policy that
students must agree and abide by. It is often that this high level
security policy, defined in administrative control documents, lends
itself to form the basis of the selection of logical and physical
controls. In other words, the logical and physical controls implement
and manifest the administrative controls.

Physical controls protect the physical hardware of computer systems
from physical and environmental threats. Some examples include locks,
closed circuit surveillance cameras (CCTV) or security guards
(protection from unauthorised accesses), cooling systems (protection
from heat), backup sites (protection from natural disasters), etc.

Logical controls protect computer systems using programmed
software. Some examples include passwords, cryptography techniques in
encryption and authentication, access controls, firewalls and intrusion
detection systems. In recent years, logical controls have received much
attention from the security community and have achieved significant
advancement. Consequently, the knowledge gained in logical controls
has also been transferred to protect and to improve physical controls,
e.g., the uses of password and cryptography techniques in modern lock.

Security is only as strong as the weakest link \cite{BS00}. In
practice, all three types of controls have to be implemented and
balanced in order to achieve security objectives in concern. For
example, for availability, strong physical controls such as a reliable
cooling system and backup site are needed to protect the physical
hardware of a computer system from physical threats. At the same time,
strong logical controls such as a strong user authentication process
and a good access control policy are also needed to protect the system
from unauthorised accesses to the services provided. The lack of
either control can easily result the system becomes unavailable.

% All three controls have to be implemented and balanced in order to
% achieve the security objective. For example, one can store data in
% $256$ bits encryption format in a public computer, yet the lack of
% physical security can easily nullify the strong logical security
% implemented. Attackers can destroy the data by simply destroying or
% taking away the data storage.

\subsection{Reevaluation}
\label{Reevaluation}
A detailed security risk analysis on large computer systems is not
feasible for every organization as it requires large amounts of time
and cost \cite{CC05}. Furthermore, new threats and vulnerabilities
emerge each day because the operational environment is constantly
changing. Therefore, security risk analysis is an ongoing iterative
process and must be indefinitely repeated.

\subsection{Summary}
\label{SecurityRiskAnalysis.SectionSummary}
The security risk analysis is summarised in Figure
\ref{fig:securityriskanalysisprocess}. The ultimate objective of
the security risk analysis is to ensure that the security controls of
the system are commensurate with the risk it is exposed to. 

%Security is concerned the protection of asset from threat. The owners
%want to protect their asset whereas the threat agents want to abuse
%them. The owner analyses the threats that are applicable to the assets
%to determine the risk involved. This helps in the selection of
%countermeasures, which in turns reduce vulnerabilities.

\section{Dynamic Coalitions and Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs)}
\label{DynamicCoalitionAndMANET}
A coalition is defined as a ``temporary alliance for combined action,
especially of political parties forming a government'' in the Oxford
Dictionary of English \cite{CS05}. This definition underpins two
important characteristics of a coalition.  Firstly, a coalition is
temporary; the alliance between parties is not permanent and will
cease to exist in the future. How long the coalition lasts depends on
the type of coalition. Secondly, an alliance is formed to achieve a
common objective, which may be difficult or even impossible to be
achieved alone by each individual party. This implies that resources
(e.g., objects, applications and services) sharing is an integral part
of a coalition. Without this common objective, each party may not be
willing to share their resources \cite{HK02}.

A dynamic coalition is a coalition which allows parties to join or
leave during the lifetime of the coalition. Some examples of dynamic
coalitions are as follows \cite{HK02, CEP02}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In a war, two or more countries may come together in an alliance
  to strengthen their forces. These countries may decide to share some
  classified information (e.g., locations of forces and bases) to
  increase the efficiency of the operation. However, a friend today
  might become a foe tomorrow; an alliance member can change sides and
  become an opponent at any point in time. The opposite can also
  occur.
\item A real-time systems research group in a university discovers a
  new highly efficient scheduling algorithm and wishes to form an
  alliance with a private automobile manufacturer and an embedded chip
  company for evaluating the performance of the algorithm in the real
  world. Given the interest, all three parties come together, form an
  alliance and share all research data generated. After the coalition
  is set up, other organizations may decide to join in or some of the
  initial members may decide to leave.
\item In the aftermath of an earthquake, the local fire and police
  department, the military forces as well as voluntary organizations
  (e.g., the Red Cross) come together and form a rescue operation
  alliance. The local department moves refugees to a safe place,
  whilst the Red Cross provides the medical and food aid. The military
  forces provide transport to make the rescue operation more
  efficient. Eventually, there is a recovery phase and basic
  infrastructure is rebuilt to get the region back to normality.
\item Mobile ac-hoc networks (MANETs), a type of networks that can be
  rapidly deployed without relying on existing infrastructure. The
  nodes in MANETs can dynamically join and leave the network,
  frequently, often without warning, and possibly without disruption
  to communication of other nodes (cf. Section \ref{MANET}).
\end{enumerate}

Resource sharing is the heart of every dynamic coalition. Each party
in a coalition hesitates to share its resources including information
with other parties in order to minimise its risk, yet sharing is
necessary to achieve the common objective of the coalition. This
problem is commonly known as the Dynamic Coalition Problem
\cite{SCS00}; having well designed access control policies and
mechanisms are vital in solving this problem.

% , they alone are not sufficient. There is an interdependent relation
% between access control and other security services \cite{RSS94},
% e.g., access control mechanisms depend on authentication services to
% establish the true identity of a user. Hence, it is vital to have a
% balanced security control measures for a system.

\subsection{Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs)}
\label{MANET}
Wireless networks have grown and changed rapidly in the last
decade. Wireless networks can be categorised into two groups:
infrastructure based networks and ad-hoc networks. In
infrastructure based networks, there are some pre-fixed equipments,
i.e., base stations to which all the mobile nodes are connected
to. All communication between the nodes pass through the base
stations. The base station can also be the gateway of a wireless
network to a wired network. When a mobile node moves out of the range
of a base station into the range of another, a hand off process is
executed automatically and the mobile node continues its connection
seamlessly with the network \cite{EMR99}. Mobile phone service
networks are good examples of this type of networks.

In ad-hoc networks (also known as infrastructureless networks), there
is no pre-fixed infrastructure that the nodes can rely on to connect
to each other. The nodes in an ad-hoc network dynamically connect to
form a multi-hop network. Each node plays the role of a router;
discovering the route and forwarding the data for other nodes
dynamically \cite{EMR99}. The ad-hoc networks are also
self-configuring and self-organizing networks.  Self-configuring in
the sense that an ad-hoc network can be formed on the fly;
self-organizing in the sense that the network can change based on its
needs, either by partitioning or merging the network with few
administrative actions. There are two types of ad-hoc networks: mobile
ad-hoc networks and sensor networks.

Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) are a subset of ad-hoc networks with
highly dynamic network topologies \cite{IC03}. Historically, MANETs
were used for military purposes. The first two projects on MANETs were
the Public Radio Network (PRNet) \cite{JJ87} and its follow up
project, Survivable Radio Networks (SURAN) \cite{DAB90}, both funded
by DAPRA\footnote{Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, an agency
  of the US Department of Defence which is responsible for the
  development of new technology for use by the military.}. Most of the
existing non-military MANETs have been developed in academic
environments. The notion of MANETs in the commercial world can be
traced to the emergence and success in the 1990s, of the IEEE 802.11
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Bluetooth. Due to the
popularity of MANETs, the term ``ad-hoc networks'' is often used
interchangeably with ``mobile ad-hoc networks'' in the literature.

Sensor networks are high density networks with a large number of
sensor nodes deployed in an area to monitor some phenomena. The
discussion on sensor networks is beyond the scope of this paper. For a
comprehensive survey on sensor networks, refer \cite{IFA02}.

\subsection{The Security Challenges of MANETs}
\label{B.DynamicCoalitionAndMANET.TheSecurityChallegesOfMANET}
The flexibility that MANETs offer comes at a price. The
infrastructureless, multi-hop nature presents many security
challenges, that are specific to MANETs, as follows \cite{IC03, SC99,
  RR02}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lack of trusted entity --- Infrastructureless is a fundamental
  characteristic of MANETs. The lack of a trusted, centralised entity
  in MANETs requires the network administrative tasks to be
  distributed among the nodes in the networks. This results in
  increased security risk as there are more possible access points for
  intrusion. Moreover, many of the existing security protocols,
  authentication and access control mechanisms rely on the existence
  of a trusted, centralised entity, e.g., public key infrastructure
  (PKI) requires a centralised trusted certification authority (CA).
\item Routing attacks --- The nodes in MANETs organize themselves to
  communicate with their neighbours in such a way as to provide
  connectivity across the networks. As the nodes are mobile and have
  the freedom to move in an arbitrary manner, the network topology
  changes frequently in an unpredictable fashion. Consequently,
  communication routes between nodes also change and network
  partitioning may happen if there is no overlap in network coverage
  of two sets (or more) of nodes. Therefore, the routing algorithm has
  to be highly adaptive and robust to accommodate these frequent
  changes. There are many possible attacks on routing identified in
  the literature. In the simplest case, the routing table in the nodes
  can be directly modified once they are captured by the
  adversaries. Furthermore, packets can be maliciously created,
  modified or dropped to change the routing table. Attack on routing
  can also be launched by making the nodes inactive or behave
  selfishly (only use services but no services provided).
\item Resource attacks --- The mobile nodes have constraints on their
  resources, in terms of power source, processing power and network
  bandwidth. The efficiency in using these resources is an important
  factor in designing MANETs. Often, the nodes in MANETs are allowed
  to switch themselves into a sleep mode to conserve energy. However,
  this in turn leads to the routing problem mentioned above. In
  contrast, sleep deprivation is another type of attack that aims to
  exhaust the power resource of the nodes by keeping the nodes active
  at all times. Furthermore, the bandwidth of wireless links is
  significantly less compared to wired links due to noise and
  interference. Consequently, there is a constraint on the amount of
  data communication in the networks.
\item Incompatibility of traditional cryptography techniques --- The
  traditional cryptography techniques cannot be directly implemented
  in MANETs due to two main reasons. Firstly, many of these techniques
  require a centralised entity which is not present in MANETs and it
  is often that no node in the networks may be assumed to be fully
  trustworthy due to the hostile operational environments. Secondly,
  traditional techniques constantly strive for more computational
  resources, yet the nodes in MANETs only have limited computational
  and power resources.
\item Inherent problems in wireless communication --- MANETs inherit
  all the security problems of wireless networks. The wireless
  communication medium is less reliable than the wired medium. It is
  necessary for the networks to be able to distinguish the variation
  in physical link performance and the possible forms of malicious
  attacks, e.g., the denial of service attacks. These attacks can
  happen at various network layers. Additionally, wireless
  communication is broadcast in open air, i.e., no physical security
  protection can be used to protect the communication channels. It is
  necessary to assume that adversaries can eavesdrop and possibly
  perform some interpretations on the transmitted signals, e.g.,
  traffic analysis. The broadcast signal can also be used by
  adversaries to disclose the location of the
  networks/nodes. Consequently, the networks are more prone to
  security threats.
\item Operational environments --- Often, MANETs are deployed in risky
  hostile environments, e.g., battlefields. It is assumed that MANETs
  face more security attacks than conventional networks. Attackers
  can, for example, capture the nodes in MANETs and use them to launch
  internal attacks.
% \item Scalability --- Whilst current existing network management
%   algorithms designed to work with a relatively stable and small
%   number of nodes, MANETs often consist of huge number of nodes. This
%   is especially true in millitary applications. The distribution of
%   administrative tasks among nodes in MANETs, due to the lack of a
%   centralised server, increases security risk as there is an increased
%   number of possible access points for intrusion. The complexity
%   introduced by distributed systems also makes development and
%   maintenance difficult.
\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{Trust and Risk Management in MANET}
%\label{TrustAndManagementInMANET}
%As a result of these challenges, MANET security has become an
%increasingly active research domain. We are particularly interested in
%the trust and risk management aspect. Security is inherently related
%to trust and risk; security risk management is an important process in
%ensuring that the security controls implemented on a system are fully
%commensurate with the risk it is exposed. Risk factors are first
%identified and then estimated, quantified and aggregated. Due to the
%dynamic feature of MANET, it is necessary to do the risk estimation
%and quantification process dynamically during operational time. The
%estimated risk is then used to guide making decisions on the
%implementation of security controls.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{ComputerSecurity.Conclusion}
This chapter presents a brief overview on computer security. It
discusses the security objectives, namely confidentiality, integrity,
availability, authenticity and accountability. It then discusses the
