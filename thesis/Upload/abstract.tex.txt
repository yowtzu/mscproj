  Current security policy development work begins with a set of
  high-level rules and then proceeds to look at the refinement
  problem. The notion of fixed benefit and risk tradeoff is implicitly
  encoded in the policy. This tradeoff often becomes suboptimal,
  especially in the case of dynamic operational environments like
  mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), in which the risk factors are
  constantly changing. Whilst evolutionary algorithms have been
  applied successfully in various areas in security domains such as
  intrusion detection system and cryptography, their application in
  security policy inference is not yet explored. This thesis
  demonstrates how evolutionary algorithms can be used to determine
  the optimal security policies that suit dynamic environments, as
  typified by MANETs.
