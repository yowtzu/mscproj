ABSTRACT="Recent research has suggested that one-size fits all security policies will
not provide the operational flexibility demanded of modern day coalition
operations. For the purposes of basic scientific research this paper takes
this understanding to its logical conclusion, and postulates the notion of
mission specific security polices, where a security policy is discovered
(using techniques from AI) that permits optimal, or at least excellent,
trade-offs to be made in multi-criteria decision problems that include
security. We illustrate the merit of this approach with some simple
simulations."

  abstract =     "In the early days a policy was a set of simple rules
                 with a clear intuitive motivation that could be
                 formalised to good effect. However the world is now
                 much more complex. Subtle risk decisions may often need
                 to be made and people are not always adept at
                 expressing rationale for what they do. Previous
                 research has demonstrated that Genetic Programming can
                 be used to infer statements of policies from examples
                 of decisions made [1]. This allows a policy that may
                 not formally have been documented to be discovered
                 automatically, or an underlying set of requirements to
                 be extracted by interpreting user decisions to posed
                 ``what if'' scenarios. This study compares the
                 performance of three different approaches in using
                 Genetic Programming to infer security policies from
                 decision examples made, namely symbolic regression,
                 IF-THEN rules inference and fuzzy membership functions
                 inference. The fuzzy membership functions inference
                 approach is found to have the best performance in terms
                 of accuracy. Also, the fuzzification and
                 de-fuzzification methods are found to be strongly
                 correlated; incompatibility between them can have
                 strong negative impact to the performance.",

The notion of fixed benefit-risk tradeoff is implicitly encoded in this policy. This tradeoff set often becomes sub-optimal, especially in the case of MANET, where risk factors are constantly changing. Following the success of using biological inspired learning techniques in machine learning and data mining, a proposal is formed to explore possibilities of using these proven techniques to better guide decision making in security policy, prior and during operational deployment of the system. These techniques are: Genetic Programming (GP), Grammatical Evoluiton (GE) and Artificial Immune System (AIS). This report provides a review of the ways trust and risk can be used to make informed decisions and outlines the research proposal and techniques."
