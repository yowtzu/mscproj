  abstract =	"Most organizations use several security policies to
		 control different systems and data, comprising in this
		 way a global complex policy. These security policies
		 are often scattered over different environments, each
		 one with its own security model, making them difficult
		 to administer and understand. Moreover, some
		 applications (e.g. workflow), often need to cross
		 several of these security domains and satisfy each one
		 of their policies, which is very difficult to
		 accomplish when these policies are scattered over the
		 organization, in conflict with each other and
		 frequently expressed in different models. This work
		 presents a security policy language that allows
		 organizations to express and keep their global security
		 policies in one single description. Although flexible
		 enough to express simultaneously several types of
		 complex security policies, this language can be easily
		 implemented by an event monitor. The proposed language
		 can express the concepts of permission and prohibition,
		 and some restricted forms of obligation. We show how to
		 express and implement obligation using the transaction
		 concept, and how to use obligation to express
		 information flow policies together with other complex
		 security policies. We also address the problem of
		 conflicting policies and show how to efficiently
		 enforce the security policies expressed by the language
		 with a security event monitor, including history-based
		 and obligation-based security policies.",

  abstract =	"Grammatical Evolution (GE) is a novel, data-driven,
		 model-induction tool, inspired by the biological
		 gene-to-protein mapping process. This study provides an
		 introduction to GE, and applies the methodology in an
		 attempt to uncover useful technical trading rules which
		 can be used to trade foreign exchange markets. In this
		 study, each of the evolved rules (programs) represents
		 a market trading system. The form of these programs is
		 not specified ex-ante, but emerges by means of an
		 evolutionary process. Daily US-DM, US-Stg and US-Yen
		 exchange rates for the period 1992 to 1997 are used to
		 train and test the model. The findings suggest that the
		 developed rules earn positive returns in hold-out
		 sample test periods, after allowing for trading and
		 slippage costs. This suggests potential for future
		 research to determine whether further refinement of the
		 methodology adopted in this study could improve the
		 returns earned by the developed rules. It is also noted
		 that this novel methodology has general utility for
		 rule-induction, and data mining applications. Copyright

  author =	"Sonja Buchegger and Jean-yves Le Boudec",
  year = 	"2003",
  month =	nov # " 11",
  abstract =	"Reputation systems in mobile ad-hoc networks can be
		 tricked by the spreading of false reputation ratings,
		 be it false accusations or false praise. Simple
		 solutions such as exclusively relying on one's own
		 direct observations have drawbacks, as they do not make
		 use of all the information available. We propose a
		 fully distributed reputation system that can cope with
		 false disseminated information. In our approach,
		 everyone maintains a reputation rating and a trust
		 rating about everyone else that they care about. From
		 time to time first-hand reputation information is
		 exchanged with others; using a modified Bayesian
		 approach we designed and present in this paper, only
		 second-hand reputation information that is not
		 incompatible with the current reputation rating is
		 accepted. Thus, reputation ratings are slightly
		 modified by accepted information. Trust ratings are
		 updated based on the compatibility of second-hand
		 reputation information with prior reputation ratings.
		 Data is entirely distributed: someone's reputation and
		 trust is the collection of ratings maintained by
		 others. We enable node redemption and prevent the
		 sudden exploitation of good reputation built over time
		 by introducing re-evaluation and reputation fading. We
		 present the application of our generic reputation
		 system to the context of neighborhood watch in mobile
		 ad-hoc networks, specifically to the CONFIDANT [3]
		 protocol for the detection and isolation of nodes
		 exhibiting routing or forwarding misbehavior. We
		 evaluate the performance by simulation.",

		 that the quality of the reputation value of trustworthy
		 and participating peers is always better than the one
		 of cheating and non participating ones. Finally we

		 networks, traditional methods used in the physical
		 world for establishing trust can no longer be used.
		 Creating virtual network substitutes with which people,
		 organisations and software agents can derive trust in
		 other parties requires computerised analysis of the
		 underlying trust networks. This article describes an
		 approach to trust network analysis using subjective
		 logic (TNA-SL), that consists of the three following
		 elements. Firstly it uses a concise notation with which
		 trust transitivity and parallel combination of trust
		 paths can be expressed. Secondly it defnes a method for
		 simplifying complex trust networks so that they can be
		 expressed in this concise form. Finally it allows trust
		 measures to be expressed as beliefs, so that derived
		 trust can be automatically and securely computed with
		 subjective logic. We compare our approach with trust
		 derivation algorithms that are based on normalisation
		 such as PageRank and EigenTrust. We also provide a
		 numerical example to illustrates how TNA-SL can be
		 applied.",

	abstract = "Role engineering is the process of designing an RBAC system.  A promising approach to
role engineering is role mining, which uses data mining techniques to find an RBAC system
from existing permission assignment data.  Role mining techniques are also useful for
optimizing and refactoring an existing RBAC system, which can become increasingly chaotic
over time. In this paper we study the problem of mining an RBAC system that optimizes
some objective measure of ``goodness'' for RBAC systems. We introduce the weighted
structural complexity measure, which sums up the sizes of different RBAC system
components (e.g., the number of roles, the number of user-role assignments, etc.),
possibly with different weights for each component. Different optimization objectives can
be achieved by choosing different weight combinations.  We show that the optimization
problem is NP-complete.  We then develop heuristic techniques for mining RBAC systems
with low weighted structural complexity. We show that the problem of mining a
hierarchical RBAC system is closely related to formal concept analysis, and develop an
algorithm using the notion of a concept lattice. We also introduce new approaches to
generating synthetic data for evaluating role mining techniques. Our experiments show
that our algorithms outperform existing approaches.

        "Currently, most security policy work begins with a set of rules and then proceeds to look at the refinement problem. The notion of fixed benefit-risk tradeoff is implicitly encoded in this policy. This tradeoff set often becomes sub-optimal, especially in the case of MANET, where risk factors are constantly changing. Following the success of using biological inspired learning techniques in machine learning and data mining, a proposal is formed to explore possibilities of using these proven techniques to better guide decision making in security policy, prior and during operational deployment of the system. These techniques are: Genetic Programming (GP), Grammatical Evoluiton (GE) and Artificial Immune System (AIS). This report provides a review of the ways trust and risk can be used to make informed decisions and outlines the research proposal and techniques."

		 to be made and people are not always adept at
		 expressing rationale for what they do. Previous
		 research has demonstrated that Genetic Programming can
		 be used to infer statements of policies from examples
		 of decisions made [1]. This allows a policy that may
		 not formally have been documented to be discovered
		 automatically, or an underlying set of requirements to
		 be extracted by interpreting user decisions to posed
		 ``what if'' scenarios. This study compares the
		 performance of three different approaches in using
		 Genetic Programming to infer security policies from
		 decision examples made, namely symbolic regression,
		 IF-THEN rules inference and fuzzy membership functions
		 inference. The fuzzy membership functions inference
		 approach is found to have the best performance in terms
		 of accuracy. Also, the fuzzification and
		 de-fuzzification methods are found to be strongly
		 correlated; incompatibility between them can have
		 strong negative impact to the performance.",

                 system, Chorus, for grammar based Evolutionary
                 Algorithms. This scheme is coarsely based on the manner
                 in nature in which genes produce proteins that regulate
                 the metabolic pathways of the cell. The phenotype is
                 the behaviour of the cells metabolism, which
                 corresponds to the development of the computer program
                 in our case. In this procedure, the actual protein
                 encoded by a gene is the same regardless of the
                 position of the gene within the genome.

                 We show that the Chorus system has a very convenient
                 Regular Expression type schema notation that can be
                 used to describe the presence of various phenotypic
                 traits. This notation is used to demonstrate that
                 massive areas of neutrality can exist in the search
                 landscape, and the system is also shown to be able to
                 dispense with large areas of the search space that are
                 unlikely to contain useful solutions.

                 The searching capability of the system is exemplified
                 by its application on a number of proof of concept
                 problems, where the system has shown comparable
                 performance to Genetic Programming and Grammatical
                 Evolution and, in certain cases, it has produced
                 superior results.

                 We also analyse the role of the crossover in the Chorus
                 System and conclude by showing its application on a
                 real world problem from the blood flow domain.",
